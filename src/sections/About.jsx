                <p className="max-w-3xl text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
                    I’m a passionate Frontend Developer with hands-on experience in building
                    real-world web applications using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and modern
                    JavaScript. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, clean, and
                    intuitive user interfaces.

                    During my internship, I worked on dashboards, forms, authentication
                    flows, and real-time features like chat systems. I’m constantly improving
                    my skills and aiming to build products that deliver real value to users.
